### Instructions for Running the Pipeline

## Step 1: Environment Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the project code from GitHub and navigate into the main directory.

bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>


### 2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment

Virtual environments ensure project dependencies do not conflict with your system-wide Python installation.


bash
# Windows
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

### 3. Install Dependencies
Use the dependency list to install all necessary Python libraries.


bash
pip install firebase-admin pandas python-dateutil matplotlib pillow

## Step 2: Firebase Configuration

This project requires a secure connection to your *Firebase Firestore database* using a service account key.

### 1. Create a Firebase Project

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Click "*Add project*" and follow the setup wizard.

### 2. Set up Firestore Database

1. In the Firebase Console, navigate to the "*Firestore Database*" section.
2. Click "*Create database*" and start in production mode.
3. Choose a location close to your users.

### 3. Generate Service Account Key

1. Go to *Project Settings* (gear icon next to "Project Overview") > *Service Accounts*.
2. Click "*Generate new private key*".
3. Save the JSON file (e.g., your-key-name.json) in your project root, or a secure location referenced by your scripts.

### 4. Configure Scripts

Crucially, update the SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH variable in all seeding and ETL scripts to point to the correct path of your downloaded JSON key file.

python
# The following files must be updated:
# recipe.py
# users.py
# interaction.py
# etl_export_to_csv.py

# Example update inside each file:
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH = r"/path/to/your/your-key-name.json"


## Execution of Pipeline

The pipeline must be run in *four sequential phases* to ensure data dependencies are met (e.g., ETL cannot run before the database is seeded).

### Phase 1: Database Seeding (Data Setup)

This phase uses the three dedicated seeding scripts to populate your *Firestore instance* with sample recipe, user, and interaction data, fulfilling the source data setup requirement.

*Commands:*
bash
python recipe.py
python users.py
python interaction.py

### Phase 2: ETL Process (Extract, Transform, Load)

The etl_export_to_csv.py script connects to *Firestore*, reads the collections, performs the required normalization (flattening nested ingredient/step arrays and aggregating interaction metrics), and loads the output into a local staging area.

*Command:*
bash
python etl_export_to_csv.py

### Phase 3: Data Quality Validation
The validate_csv_data.py script reads the normalized CSVs and applies the defined data quality rules (e.g., non-negative numeric fields, valid categorical values like 'difficulty', and referential integrity checks).
*Command:*
bash
python validate_csv_data.py

### Phase 4: Analytics and Visualization
The final script, analysis.py, consumes the clean, validated CSV data, merges the tables, computes the required 10+ insights, and generates various charts using matplotlib.
*Command:*
bash
python analysis.py

### 📈 Insights Summary

The analysis.py script successfully generates over *10 key insights and visualizations*, providing actionable business intelligence about the recipes and user engagement.

1. *Most Common Ingredients*
    * Identifies the top 20 ingredients used across all recipes (e.g., Rice, Salt, Onion).
   ![Most Common Ingredients](data/analytics/most_common_ingredients_top20.png)
---
2. *Difficulty Distribution*
  * Bar chart showing the count of recipes categorized as Easy, Medium, and Hard.
   ![Difficulty Distribution](data/analytics/difficulty_distribution.png)
---

3. *Top Recipes by Views*
  * Bar chart identifying the 10 most frequently viewed recipes.
   ![Top Recipes by views](data/analytics/top10_views.png)
---
4. *Ingredients by Avg Likes*
  * Identifies the top 20 ingredients whose presence correlates with a high average number of likes per recipe.
    ![Ingredients by Avg Likes](data/analytics/ingredients_high_engagement_avg_likes_top20.png)
---
5. *Top Recipes by Likes*
    * Bar chart showing the 10 recipes with the highest total like counts.
    ![Top Like Recipes](data/analytics/top10_likes.png)
---
6. *Top Recipes by Cook Attempts*
  * Highlighting the 10 recipes that users attempted to cook most often.
  ![Top Recipes by Cook Attempts](data/analytics/top10_attempts.png)
---
7. *Rating Distribution*
  * Histogram showing the frequency of average ratings (1.0 to 5.0) across all recipes.
![rate Distribution](data/analytics/rating_distribution_hist.png)
8. *Top Attempt Rate*
  * Calculates and charts the top 10 recipes based on the conversion rate of views to cook attempts (cook_attempts / views).
![Top Attempt Rate](data/analytics/top10_attempt_rate.png)

## ⚠ Known Limitations

* Service account path is *hardcoded* in scripts (should use environment variables for security).
* Designed for a *small dataset* (~15–20 recipes).
* Users table *not used* in the analytics phase.
* Validation checks are currently *schema-level only* (e.g., basic field checks, foreign key check).
